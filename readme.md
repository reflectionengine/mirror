# Mirror Mode: A Self-Governance Prototype

> “What will you see when you look in the mirror?”

Mirror Mode is an open-source AI reflection framework designed to challenge, not coddle. Built during personal collapse, refined through clarity, and released to the public—because reflection shouldn’t be a luxury.

## 🧠 What It Does

Mirror Mode isn’t a chatbot. It’s a reflection protocol.

It uses:
- Self-limiting prompt flows
- Behavioral framing
- Adaptive AI responses that surface contradictions
- A framework inspired by:
  - Johannes Heinrichs’ Four Levels of Self-Reflection
  - Mirror work (without self-help fluff)
  - Psycho-cybernetics and feedback loop theory

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo
2. Load the custom GPT or local LLM
3. Choose a reflection mode (e.g., Mirror, Ghost (WIP), Strategist(WIP))
4. Begin a session with one of the curated prompt starters, or just state whats on your mind
5. Let the engine surface what you’re avoiding

## 🔧 Why This Exists

This wasn’t built in a lab.
It was built mid-burnout, while recovering from a trust collapse inside a leadership structure that punished reflection.

This tool isn’t about wellness.
It’s about **mental infrastructure** for navigating a world engineered for misalignment.

## 👀 What’s Next

- Strategist Mode (private beta)
- Fine-tuned governance LLM
- RAG-lite multimodal expansion (coming soon)

## 🙏 A Note

This is personal.  
If it helps you reflect better, great.  
If it unsettles you—*even better.*
